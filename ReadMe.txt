The program file is RackSpace.java under rackSpace package folder.
The command format: 
java rackSpace.RackSpace [fileName1] [fileName2]...
I have aslo indcluded serveral text files which can be used as input:
TeddyBears.txt, TheMarchingMorons.txt, smallTest.txt

I create serveral test cases in RackSpaceTest.java. Please see the comments
in the code for details. The compilation requires
two .jar files I have provided. To run the test, use the following command:
java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore rackSpace.RackSpaceTest
